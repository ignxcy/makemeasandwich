# ðŸ¥ª makemeasandwich

ðŸ’¡ This shell script adds a fun twist to the classic "make me a sandwich" meme. It simulates a conversation where someone asks for a sandwich, and when they request it with sudo, the script comically responds, "okay." It's a light-hearted demonstration of how sudo can be used humorously in a shell script.
